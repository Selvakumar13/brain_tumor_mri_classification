# brain_tumor_mri_classification

The aim of this project is the development of a deep learning model for classification of brain tumor MRI.
The various tasks performed include:-
•	We employed a deep learning classification technique to develop a machine learning model that classifies brain tumor MRI images into four categories i.e  Glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor and no tumor. The initial dataset contained 826 images for glioma tumor,822 images for meningioma tumor,827 images for pituitary tumor and 395 images in the no tumor category .
•	To overcome the limitations of data samples, particularly image data sets we used data augmentation .
•	We performed one-hot encoding on the labeled data since Categorical data are variables that have label values rather than numeric values. Many machine learning algorithms are unable to directly function on label data. They require that all input and output variables be numeric.
•	We achieved a training accuracy of 98.7 percent and a validation accuracy of 92.19 percent utilizing our simple architecture and no prior region-based segmentation. These results are comparable to those obtained by more complex region-based segmentation methods.
